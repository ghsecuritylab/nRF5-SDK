# nRF5-SDK
Software development kit for the nRF52 series and the nRF51 series SoC

This is (**unofficial**) repository of Nordic's nRF5-SDK available here: https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Software/nRF5-SDK

The nRF5 SDK is your first stop for building fully featured, reliable and secure applications with the nRF52 and nRF51 Series. It offers developers a wealth of varied modules and examples right across the spectrum including numerous Bluetooth Low Energy profiles, Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU), GATT serializer and driver support for all peripherals on all nRF5 Series devices. The nRF5 SDK will almost certainly have something for your needs in developing exciting yet robust wireless products.

# Available Protocols

- Bluetooth® Low Energy brings wireless connectivity to small, low-cost devices that require months to years of battery lifetime.
- ANT™ is a proven, ultra low power, flexible and easy-to-use network protocol for 2.4GHz ISM band communication.
- Complete range of ultra-low power 2.4GHz ISM band solutions including wireless system-on-chips, protocol stacks, development tools, and reference designs.
